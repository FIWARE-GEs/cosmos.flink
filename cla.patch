+# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
+
+## Our Pledge
+
+We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for
+everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity
+and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
+or sexual identity and orientation.
+
+We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
+
+## Our Standards
+
+Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
+
+-   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
+-   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
+-   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
+-   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
+-   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
+
+Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
+
+-   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
+-   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
+-   Public or private harassment
+-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
+-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
+
+## Enforcement Responsibilities
+
+Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take
+appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
+or harmful.
+
+Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
+issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
+moderation decisions when appropriate.
+
+## Scope
+
+This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing
+the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting
+via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
+
+## Enforcement
+
+Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible
+for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
+
+All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
+
+## Enforcement Guidelines
+
+Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem
+in violation of this Code of Conduct:
+
+### 1. Correction
+
+**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the
+community.
+
+**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation
+and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
+
+### 2. Warning
+
+**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
+
+**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including
+unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
+interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a
+temporary or permanent ban.
+
+### 3. Temporary Ban
+
+**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
+
+**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified
+period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those
+enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
+
+### 4. Permanent Ban
+
+**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate
+behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
+
+**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
+
+## Attribution
+
+This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 2.0, available at
+https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.
+
+Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by
+[Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

+# Contributing to <PROJECT NAME>
+
+Thanks for checking out the <PROJECT NAME> Project. We're excited to hear and learn from you. We've put together the following
+guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.
+
+## Ground rules & expectations
+
+Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):
+
+-   Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and
+    projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others
+    rather than convince them that your way is correct.
+-   This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this
+    project, you agree to abide by its terms.
+-   If you open a pull request, you must sign the
+    [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://fiware.github.io/contribution-requirements/individual-cla.pdf) by
+    stating in a comment _"I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"_
+-   Please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them
+    before we can merge your contribution.
+-   When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or
+    your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.
+
+## How to contribute
+
+If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/<GIT_HUB_PATH>/issues) and
+[pull requests](https://github.com/<GIT_HUB_PATH>/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or
+question.
+
+If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
+
+-   **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
+-   **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can
+    weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
+
+## Community
+
+Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's
+[Issues](https://github.com/<GIT_HUB_PATH>/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/<GIT_HUB_PATH>/pulls)
+sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.
+
+Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly.
+Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
